Cost Function

We can measure the accuracy of our hypothesis function by using a cost function. This takes an average difference (actually a fancier version of an average) of all the results of the hypothesis with inputs from x's and the actual output y's.


This function is otherwise called the "Squared error function", or "Mean squared error". The mean is halved as a convenience for the computation of the gradient descent, as the derivative term of the square function will cancel out the
